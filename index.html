    <h2><span>Virtual Cursor Gesticulation by Hand Gestures and Speech Interaction</span></h2>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Our project's main objective is to revolutionize the way we interect with computers by introducing a virtual cursor controlled solely through hand gestures and speech recognition.This advanced system is designed to smoothly perform all mouse and keyboard functions,eliminating the requirement for extra hardware. By utilizing just a webcam and a microphone,our virtual cursor surpasses the limitations of conventional input devices, making computer interaction more intuitive and accessible. It simply redifines the traditional mouse and keyboard usage through hand gestures and voice commands.</p>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>Our project "Virtual Cursor Gesticulation by Hand Gestures and Speech Interaction" redifines traditional mouse usage by combining computer vision for hand gestures and speech recognition. Using intuitive hand movements, users can perform actions like clicking and scrolling. Additionally,speech commands offer a hands-free alternative for seamless interaction.While traditional input devices have limitations,our goal is not only to overcome these challenges but also to provide users with a more intuitive and efficient means of interaction.By introducing speech recognition into the mix,we extend the possibilities,allowing users to control their screens through both gestures and voice commands,creating a versatile and user-friendly interface. </p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This project is to develop a Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture and Speech Recognition. The
        hand gestures and speech recognition are the most effortless and natural way of
        communication.</li>
        <li>The aim is to perform various operations of the cursor to reduce the usage of physical devices
        as they are cost effective and the lifetime of a hardware device is limited.</li>
        <li>Instead of using more expensive sensors, a simple web camera and a microphone can identify the gesture and the voice commands and perform the actions.<br>
        <li>It helps the user to interact with a computer without any physical and hardware device to control mouse operation.</li>
        <li>It can also reduce the spread of diseases or viruses as there would be a less intercation with keyboard and mouse.</li>
        <li>We use Open Cv for Gesture Recognition and Mediapipe for Hand Tacking.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Our System begins by capturing the live video and audio inputs, detecting the user'hand within the video feed and identify palm area. It then recognizes specific hand gestures and interprets spoken commands, translating these inputs into actions that control the virtual cursor, such as moving, clicking, scrolling......
